directions:
try changing the loss to classification loss

try using different dataset


try on datasets with actual ovvluded faces especially
how to account for at least some masking of pixels

check if the mask is actullay doing something


check loss of astn



visualize the masks




TODO:
 you are actually moving  on the loss manifold twice using the same output which is wrong. When you update the classifier the adversary has already moved making the gradietn wrong for the current update.


 DO batch normalization

detach the fetures like the fake in detached



slow down the lr of the  classiofier to show to the adversary as if the classifier is fixed. so at each step the adversary will learn the least size mask
